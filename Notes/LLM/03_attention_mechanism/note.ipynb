    "        - with trainable weight that form the basis of LLM\n",
    "    3. casual attention\n",
    "        - add mask to self attention, allow LLM generate 1 word at a time\n",
    "        - only consider current and previous input in sequence, ensure temporal order\n",
    "    4. multi-head attention\n",
    "        - extension of casual and self attention, to attend to information from different representation subspace\n",

    "    - pre-LLM architecture:\n",
    "        - when translate, cannot translate word by word due to grammatical structure difference\n",
    "        - common to use deep NN with encoder + decoder\n",
    "        - before transformer, RNN was the most famouse encoder-decoder architecture for language translation\n",

    "            - suit for sequential data like text\n",
    "            - encoder process input text 1 by 1 and update internal state in hidden layer\n",
    "            - decoder use the final hidden state to generate output\n",
    "            - limitation: e-d RNN cant directly access earlier hidden state from encoder during decoding phase\n",
    "                - only rely on current hidden state\n",

    "        - update on RNN\n",
    "        - decoder can selectively access different parts of input sequence at each decoding step\n",
